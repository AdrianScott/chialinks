<h1>Chia Asset Tokens (CATs)</h1>
<p>CATs are tokens created on the Chia blockchain that follow the <a href="https://chialisp.com/docs/puzzles/cats/" target="_blank">CAT1 standard</a>. This is similar to the ERC-20 token standard on the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>To access a particular CAT, you can import the <strong>asset ID</strong> into a <a href="/wallets">compatible wallet</a>. Currently the only compatible wallet is the Official Chia Light Wallet</p>
