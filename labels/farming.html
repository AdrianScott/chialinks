<h1>Farming / Mining</h1>
<p>Farming is the process of checking your plots every ~8 seconds to attempt to find a proof in order to be rewarded Chia (XCH) coins. Sometimes this process is referred to as Chia Mining.</p>
<p><em>ChiaLinks cannot guarantee or endorse any third party tools. There is a screening process in place for open source projects to ensure no malicious code at the time of inclusion but there is no guarantee that the code has not changed since. There have been tools in the past that have become malicious resulting in lost XCH and compromised private keys. Use at your own risk.</em></p>
