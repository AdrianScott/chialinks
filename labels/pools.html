<h1>Farming Pools</h1>
<p>Farming pools allow a group of farmers to combine their farms in order to earn more consistent rewards. See this <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Pooling-FAQ" target="_blank">official pooling FAQ</a> for more information about how pools work in Chia.</p>
<p><strong><u>NEVER</u></strong> share your private key (24-word mnemonic) with anyone. Properly implemented pools should not require sharing your private key nor ask you to install any third party software.</p>
<p>Only pools following the official Chia pooling protocol (released July 8, 2021) are listed here.</p>
